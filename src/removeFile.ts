/**
 * Constructs a Solana transaction to remove a file from a  file system,
 * identified by a file system ID (`fsid`) and a UTF-8 encoded file path.
 *
 * @param fsid - A stringified integer representing the file system ID in which the file resides.
 * @param path - The full path to the file to be deleted.
 * @param wallet - The public key of the wallet that signs and authorizes the transaction.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a Solana `Transaction` object containing the remove file instruction.
 * @throws May throw an error if `path` is invalid per `sanitizePath`.
