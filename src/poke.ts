/**
 * Constructs a Solana transaction to perform a poke\operation, which writes data
 * to a file at the specified path and byte position.
 *
 * @param fsid - A stringified integer representing the file system ID where the file resides.
 * @param path - The path to the file to be written to.
 * @param position - The byte offset in the file where data should be written.
 * @param wallet - The public key of the wallet that signs and authorizes the transaction.
 * @param dataKey - A public key of a data account that holds the content to be written to the file.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a Solana `Transaction` object containing the poke instruction.
 * @throws Will throw an error if the `path` contains invalid characters.
