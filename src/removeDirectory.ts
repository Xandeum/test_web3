/**
 * Constructs a Solana transaction to perform a "remove directory" operation
 * in a  file system, identified by a file system ID (`fsid`).
 *
 * @param fsid - A stringified integer representing the file system ID containing the directory.
 * @param path - The full path to the directory that should be removed.
 * @param wallet - The public key of the wallet that will sign and authorize the transaction.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a Solana `Transaction` object containing the remove directory instruction.
 * @throws May throw an error if the `path` fails validation in `sanitizePath`.
