/**
 * Constructs a Solana transaction to rename (or move) a file or directory
 * within a file system, based on a provided file system ID (`fsid`).
 *
 * @param fsid - A stringified integer representing the file system ID where the path exists.
 * @param oldPath - The current path of the file or directory to be renamed or moved.
 * @param name - The new name to assign to the file or directory.
 * @param wallet - The public key of the wallet that signs and authorizes the transaction.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a Solana `Transaction` object containing the rename path instruction.
 * @throws May throw an error if either `oldPath` or `newPath` is invalid per `sanitizePath`.
